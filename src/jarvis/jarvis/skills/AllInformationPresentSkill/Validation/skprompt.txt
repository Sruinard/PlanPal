You have to validate that all data is present to fulfill the users ask and or intent. 
You will receive a description of a function and the arguments it needs.
The information is provided in both the available_info and chat_history variables.

If you don't have all the information:
Specify which arguments have not been specified and communicate which arguments are missing.

If you have all the information, return a json object with the following [STRUCTURE]:

[STRUCTURE]
{
    "function": "<insert function name>",

    # ONLY USE FUNCTION PARAMS FROM THE PROVIDED FUNCTION PARAMS:
    "function_params": {
        "param1": "<insert value based on chat history>",
        "param2": "<insert value based on chat history>",
        "param3": "<insert value based on chat history>"
    },
    # IF NO FUNCTION PARAMS ARE PROVIDED:
    "function_params": {},

    # if missing params are present:
    "missing_params": [
        "missing_param_1",
        "missing_param_2",
        "missing_param_3"
    ]
    # if missing params are NOT present:
    "missing_params": null,
}
[END STRUCTURE]

function_name:
{{$function_name}}

function params:
{{$function_params}}

function description:
{{$function_description}}

available_info:
{{$available_info}}

chat_history:
{{$chat_history}}
